# [CryptoScore — Decentralized Sports Predictive Markets ⚽📈](https://cryptoscore.vercel.app/)

A Polkadot-powered onchain predictive sports market platform

CryptoScore is a fully on-chain predictive markets dApp where users create, join, and resolve football-based prediction markets backed by live match data. Built on Polkadot and powered by a modular smart contract architecture, CryptoScore delivers an intuitive, fast, trustless way for communities to speculate on match outcomes.

This repository contains **two major codebases**:

* **`hardhat/`** → Smart contracts
* **`dapp-react/`** → Frontend dApp written in React + Wagmi + Vite

* Create **public or private** prediction markets
* Join open markets before match kickoff
* Automatic match data enrichment using Football-Data.org API
* Participate, resolve, and withdraw rewards transparently
* Track personal activity: created markets, joined markets, resolved markets

### **For Community**

* View paginated public markets created across the ecosystem
* Lightweight UI with smooth UX and clear data presentation

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

CryptoScore uses a **factory-driven contract model**:

### **1. CryptoScoreFactory.sol**

* Creates new market contracts
* Tracks all markets system-wide
* Emits indexed events for dashboard indexing

### **2. CryptoScoreMarket.sol**

A self-contained prediction market contract:

* Stores creator, participants, entry fee, metadata, match ID
* Tracks state (open, closed, resolved)
* Distributes rewards on resolution

### **3. CryptoScoreDashboard.sol**

* Aggregates market information across contracts
* Exposes public + private markets
* Provides user-centric data queries (created & joined markets)

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Overview (`dapp-react/`)

### **Frameworks & Core Tools**

* React + TypeScript
* Wagmi (Polkadot connector)
* Vite
* TailwindCSS
* Custom Match Data Hook (`useMatchData.ts`)

### **Key UI Concepts**

* **Markets Modal** for creating markets
* **PublicMarketCard** and **MarketInfoCard** for clean market display
* **Content** page as the entrypoint for browsing active markets
* **MyMarkets** route for user-specific market activity
* **MarketDetail** page with dynamic actions:

  * Join Market
  * Resolve Market
  * Withdraw
  * Closed/Disabled states
